# PrepTrack 📚⚙️

A mobile app for students in **preparatory institutes for engineering studies**, built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**.

We built this app because we’ve been in their shoes — we know how intense prepa life can be. The goal: help students stay organized, motivated, and connected.

### 📱 Features:
- 🗓️ Timetable – plan your sessions by subject
- ⏱️ Study timer – track focused time per subject
- ✅ To-do lists – manage tasks with subject filters
- 📌 Deadline tracker – never miss an important date
- 📘 Subjects section – organize notes and progress
- 💬 Forum – ask questions, share answers
- 🗨️ Chatroom – discuss with other students
- 🏆 Gamification – earn points, unlock badges
- 📊 Leaderboard – see top performing students

### 🎯 Subject-based everything:
All timers, to-dos, and trackers are filtered by your actual subjects for smarter study tracking.

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- **Flutter** for frontend
- **Firebase** for backend (auth, storage, realtime database)

### 🚀 Getting Started:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Set up Firebase and link your config
4. Run the app on your device or emulator
